          	Kids Hub is an event that takes place once a school term. This event is held to talk to children about music they listen to and how these music influence them. We teach them to listen age appropriate music. </p>
    <p> We have learned that the tarvens in our surrounding areas play music that are not age appropriate for our children and they learn just to sing with to the lyrics of these songs and they don't understand what is being sung.
